[Gulp](https://github.com/SkinlessApps/gulp) is a better, smarter javascript template engine based on the phenomenal work of https://github.com/paularmstrong/gulp/
Most of the README is from the original gulp README.

Features
--------

* Available for node.js **and** major web browsers!
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/) compatible.
* Object-Oriented template inheritance.
* Apply filters and transformations to output in your templates.
* Automatically escapes all output for safe HTML rendering.
* Lots of iteration and conditionals supported.
* Robust without the bloat.
* Extendable and customizable. See [Gulp-Extras](https://github.com/paularmstrong/gulp-extras) for some examples.
* Great [code coverage](http://paularmstrong.github.io/gulp/coverage.html).

Basic Example
-------------

### Template code

```html
<h1>{{ pagename|title }}</h1>
<ul>
{% for author in authors %}
    <li{% if loop.first %} class="first"{% endif %}>{{ author }}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
```

### node.js code

```js
var gulp  = require('gulp');
var template = gulp.compileFile('/absolute/path/to/template.html');
var output = template({
    pagename: 'awesome people',
    authors: ['Paul', 'Jim', 'Jane']
});
```

### Output

```html
<h1>Awesome People</h1>
<ul>
    <li class="first">Paul</li>
    <li>Jim</li>
    <li>Jane</li>
</ul>
```

How it works
------------

Gulp reads template files and translates them into cached javascript functions. When we later render a template we call the evaluated function, passing a context object as an argument.
